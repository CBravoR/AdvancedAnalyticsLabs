For their final capital requirement allocation, the bank may want to adjust this to their own load. Most banks in Canada have an 11.5% load that they would use to estimate their capital requirements, but that does not impact the RWA of the asset under a Standard Approach, just the final (and obviously more important) capital allocation."
