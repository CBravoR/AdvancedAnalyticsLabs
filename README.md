# AdvancedAnalyticsLabs
Analytics labs notebooks, supporting analytics teaching for BSc and MSc business school modules. Currently, there are 9 labs (out of 12) uploaded divided into three topics:

## Intro to Python and Revenue Management

1. [Introduction to Python](Lab_1_Introduction_to_Python.ipynb): First few steps. Simple intro for people who might be already familiar with other languages, not meant for people with no programming experience!

2. [Revenue Management](Lab_2_Revenue_Management.ipynb): Implementation of simple algorithms (Littlewood, EMSR-a and EMSR-b). Also teaches about functions, assignments, etc.

## Credit Scoring

3. [Data Preprocessing](Lab_3_Preprocessing.ipynb): Simple data preprocessing using pandas and scikit-learn.

4. [Weight of evidence transformation](Lab_4_WoE.ipynb): How to calculate Weight of Evidence transformations in Python.

5. [Logistic Regression](Lab_5_Logistic_Regression.ipynb): Intro to scikit-learn and how to run a Lasso and Ridge regression.

6. [Scorecards and Random Forest](Lab_6_Scorecards_and_Ensembles.ipynb): How to estimate a scorecard, run a Random Forest, and compare ROC curves.

## Deep Learning

7. [Introduction to Keras and Shallow ANN](Lab_7_Keras_and_Shallow_Neural_Networks.ipynb): Gentle introduction to Keras and Tensorflow.

8. [Embeddings](Lab_8_Embeddings.ipynb): How to calculate embedding layers, and how to use pre-trained embeddings. Currently uses Facebook's [fasttext library](https://fasttext.cc/).

9. [1D CNN and Keras' Model API](Lab_9_ConvNets_for_Text_Analytics.ipynb): Intro to CNN, and how to use Keras' Model API. Also contains an implementation of [Kim et al. (2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) CNN for text analytics.

These labs are available under the GPL v3, feel free to use them as you wish. I'll be grateful if you can point to the Github, as I'll keep these updated in subsequent iterations of the modules where I teach this. As always, these notebooks are provided with no guarantees.

Comments are welcome!
